        <h2>Website Topic</h2>
        <p>The website I create for the purposes of this project will be a repository of comics/manga I have created. As a secondary purpose, it may expand to serve as an archive for content such as written works, videos, and miscellaneous drawings, though that may prove to be beyond the scope of this assignment.</p>

        <h2>Website Title</h2>
        <p>RJ's Art and Things of Interest</p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            The author of the first webcomic, Eric Millikin, valued the Internet because it allowed him the creative freedom to self publish his work without concerning himself over censorship or pleasing specific demographics. I value the Internet for the similar reasons, and dislike the concept of target demographics.
        </p>

        <p>
            By definition, repeated visitors to my website will probably be people who are interested in what I make. This may include fans of comics, sculptures, parodies of specific media, animation, the strange, and the incomprehensible. However, I have no intention of tailoring what I make to suite anyone's interests but my own. The most I would do would be to ensure my website is organized and simple to navigate, so that my family and I could easily locate specific works. I'm aware that my grandparents struggle with computer literacy.
        </p>

        <p>Ideally, the majority of people to visit my website would be those to whom I have personally presented a link.</p>

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>

        <p>The site I create should serve as an archive of my work. It is intended to make my most important projects easily accessible to myself, as well as to those with whom I wish to share them. Through my personal website, I ultimately hope to organize my chaotic and unfocussed collection of art and story fragments by continuity. I also hope to backup my work against the event of its physical destruction or the destruction of locally stored digital copies.</p>

        <h2>Comparable Sites</h2>

        <ul class="linkslist">
            <li>http://www.fluffy.com/fluffy/Fluffyhome.html</li>
            <li>https://www.undefined.net/1/0/?strip=311</li>
            <li>https://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=350217&no=31&weekday=tue/</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Content/Features</h2>

        <p>Note: Depending on how far I take my personal site over the course of this assignment, some of these features may not apply. For the purposes of this class I intend to make establishing a framework for webcomics my first priority, and expand on other ideas (marked here as "possible") in my own time.</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Navigation bar/list including links to different pages representing different mediums (possible)</li>

            <li>Alternative navigation bar/list including links to various shared continuities (possible)</li>

            <li>Navigation bars/lists containing links to individual works or chapters</li>

            <li> Images</li>

            <li>Videos (possible)</li>

            <li>Back and forward arrows (images linked for the purpose of navigating to immediately previous/subsequent chapters)</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Site Personality</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Sparse</li>
            <li>Organized</li>
            <li>Simplistic</li>
            <li>Archaic</li>
            <li>90s (possibly)</li>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Obscure</li>
            <li>Secret</li>
            
        </ul>
        
 <p>If a stranger were to stumble upon my personal website, I’d hope they'd feel like they’d found something they were never meant to. Side effects may include intrigue and confusion.</p>
        
        <h2>Limitations</h2>

        <p>I'd like to be able to look up my stories on go, so ideally my website should work smoothly on mobile devices. Further taking the speed of grandfather’s internet into account, it would be preferable if it demanded little bandwidth. My personal website should be able to run on common browsers like Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, and especially on Google Chrome, because that's what I rely on the most.</p>
