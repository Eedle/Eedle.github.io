                A webserver is a piece of physical hardware hosting one or more websites. Through software making use of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, a webserver can deliver the files that comprise said sites to other machines as requested through the World Wide Web, where they are then interpreted by the receiver’s http client.

        <h2>Why You Need a Webserver</h2>

        <p>A webserver is necessary if you intend to host your website on the World Wide Web. </p>

        <h2>Why it Takes more Than a Domain Name to Host a Website</h2>

        <p> A domain name is what identifies a website, but it isn’t what hosts it. The acquisition of a domain name is similar to acquiring a license to host a website under that specific name, and does not provide the means to host it in of itself.</p>

        <h2>Common Webhosting Company Services</h2>

        <p>Standard Services provided by a webhosting company include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Webhosting</li>
            <li>An Email Account</li>
            <li>FTPS Uploads</li>

        </ul>

        <p>A Webhosting Company can provide the option for the owner of a domain name to create email addresses ending with said domain name as apposed to an extension of a webmail service provider such as gmail.com. FTTPS Access allows the user to upload files created locally on their machine to the hosted webserver</p>

        <p>Some Webhosting services also include with their subscription tools that make it easier for beginners to build websites without relying on the use of html. To this end, the support of wordpress as a building tool is often included. Anyone can run wordpress software for free, but to put a site made with wordpress on the web a wordpress host is required. Wordpress hosts may also offer unique upgrades to the program, as wordpress’s code is open source.</p>

        <h2>What to look for When Selecting a Webhosting Company</h2>

        <p>Things to consider when searching for a website hosting company include the quality of their costumer services, the price of subscription, whether they’ll try to trick you into paying fees that aren’t immediately obvious, and the “uptime” of their server (how often the server hosting your website can be expected to run). </p>

        <p>Uptime is often listed as a percent. It is difficult to independently verify, and companies often fail to list what the uptime is a percentage of. It you do the math, the difference between 90% of a month, day, or a week can result in a very different number of hours that your website will be available.</p>

        <p>Other things to consider might include whether you want your website to have dedicated hosting or shared hosting. Hosting your website on a shared server means that website’s belonging to other users are also hosted on that server. Shared servers can translate to less responsibility for the site creator as they may have a support staff of technicians, but also allow for less control. Dedicated servers are servers dedicated to a single user, and offer things like full administrative privileges.</p>

        <h2>Average Price Range of Webhosting Companies</h2>

        <p> On average, hosting a single website on a shared server costs about 3.40 dollars per month.</p>

        <h2>Website Hosting, Personal Preferences</h2>

        <p>Costumer service and user friendly webpage creating tools would not fall high on my list of priorities when selecting a webhosting site. I’d prefer to host my website on a dedicated server, but it most cases it looks like that would be out of my price range. Since I don’t intend to do anything too fancy with my website anyway, a shared server seems like it would be a good place to start.</p>

        <h2>Comparisons</h2>

        <h3>Preface</h3>

       <p>Across the Internet, ordered lists ranking the top website hosts have proved to be inconsistent with each other. In fact, at least two of the first lists that popped up in my search results (those by TheBestWebhosting.com, and Top10.Com) clearly stated they received referral fees from partners, and that this biases the order in which websites are represented. In other words, finding credible information was a challenge.</p>

       <p>I thought I spent enough time looing, so I eventually settled on WhoIsHostingTHis.com. While the extension .com makes it clear that it is a commercial website with its own commercial interests, at a glance it seems to have a decent reputation, posts its own accurate looking guides on how evaluate a website’s credibility, and it claims it’s ranking list is based off the averages of real consumer reviews. The credentials of the man who posted the list also seem legitimate (or are at least backed up by external websites) and relevant.</p>

       <p> WhoISHosting.Com has reviewed every website on the list, so I took a look at the top three. I should note that each review offered an exclusive link that provided a discount on the Internet in question, so it’s obvious that that WhoIsHostingThis.Com has also made some kind of deal with said web service providers. However, they claim that their referral fees do not influence them to disguise adds as endorsements, and the user reviews seem legitimate.</p>

       <h2>Best Company/Hosting Plan (of the Three Listed) </h2>

       <p>Based on the table I compiled alone, without taking any other factors into consideration, I’d judge bluehost to offer the best value for it’s cheapest subscription. However, I do think there are many other factors to consider.</p>

       <p>The subscription a user considers best for its price will likely depend on their individual needs and preferences. For example, if the use is particularly eco conscious, they might place further value on inmotion for its promise of “green servers”. Inmotion also offers special deals favorable to mall businesses. If the user is already comfortable with html, they might not consider tools that make website creation easier to be a high priority.  Siteground is well known for it’s costumer service, which paired with it’s reasonable shared hosting prices could create smoother experience for a beginner, but more experienced users may prefer greater control over their own dedicated server for a cheaper cost. </p>

       <p> Siteground is particularly well known for its costumer service. Siteground seems to offer a number of webhosting options, and differently priced subscriptions. It offers its services as a wordpress host. It also provides options for shared hosting, woo hosting, and cloudhosting. It isn’t very clear which subscriptions are categorized as shared hosting and which are categorized as dedicated hosting or if they are classed in a separate hosting category. The criteria used to define the main categories appear to be inconsistent. To get a comprehensive picture of all it’s plans, I was forced to rely on an external website. The shared hosting options are considerably cheaper than its cloudhosting prices, which are also very expensive compared to industry standard. The same applies to their dedicated hosting plans, which are hidden behind a lot of text.</p>

       <p>Each choice, webhosting (shared hosting), dedicated hosting, wordpress hosting, and cloud hosting are further subdivided into three subscriptions distinguished by the amount of web space available, the number of websites hosted, and the number of visits per month. The cheapest available package for hosting one website is priced at 3.95$ per month. However, this is listed as a “special price”, and it’s stated that the “regular” cost is 11.95$ per month. It isn’t made clear on their page exactly what this means. I learned through an external site that the special price is only available for the first term, which is variable, and depends on how long your willing to commit to using siteground as your web provider. It’s also worth noting that its wordpress plan is significantly cheaper for the number of features it provides than the majority of wordpress plans offered by other companies.</p>

       <p>After looking at user feedback, it seems that bluehost, which provides word press as a website building tool, is very beginner oriented, and the support staff is unwilling or unable to answer questions to do with actual html or coding. After Visiting Blue Host myself, I also found that it tried to disguise hidden fees. While one’s basic plan 2.75$ subscription is refundable within the first 30 days, if the subscription included a free domain name the user is required to pay 15.99$. Blue host actually provides a number of differently priced subscriptions for shared hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicate hosting. The basic plan is a shared hosting plan and is the cheapest of the plans they offer. All their plans include hidden fees.</p>

       <p>Inmotion seems to offer more plans than either bluehost or siteground. As with Siteground, it’s not immediately obvious which categories overlap with dedicated and shared hosting. Vaguer categories include “website creator” and “business hosting”. Each such main category is further subdivided might be subdivided into as many as six options. A lot of choices comes with a lot of research to make sure you’re making the right one, so inmotion seems like it would be a bit of a time investment. Inmotion is convenient in that the service will automatically renew a user’s domain name if they forget, so that they don’t lose it. On the other hand, if one forgot that feature they might end up spending money for something they don’t use anymore. </p>

       <p>It’s cheapest subscription inmotion offers (per month after the first month) is it’s business hosting description, which is priced at 7.99$ per month. This subscription includes a free domain, two websites, and unlimited disk space, as apposed to the 10 GB of space promised in siteground’s basic subscription, so this might be the preferable option if one needed to run a website for their small business. Their wordpress subscription is also cheaper than siteground’s wordpress subscription, which is priced the same as their cheapest web subscription. Comparatively, it also offers more space at 40 GB as apposed to 10 again from siteground.</p>
