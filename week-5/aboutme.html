I've developed a habit of sharing the things I love with my grandfather. We live a distance apart and don't visit each other often, but when I do visit, I like to bring books.  A year or two ago, I started him on the journey to completing my favorites series- a manga called "Pandora Hearts"- which suites him well, since he prefers books with pictures.
                
The last time I visited, I left him with my favorite volume of the series. My grandfather isn't particularly well versed in methods of electronic communication, so waiting until next I saw him to discuss the book grew arduous. It was as a means to vent that restless a as well as thank him for putting up with my interests that I decided to create 3-dimensional representations of a pair of stuffed rabbits that were central to the book's plot.
                
The rabbit was certainly not the most complex clay model I had attempted, and the first, which I made for myself, was completed over the course of a single night. The second was more difficult. The difficulty I largely attribute to this: a lack of inspiration. 
                
By virtue of being a new form, the first attempt had forced me to invent new techniques to counter new problems. The bow was especially difficult- it required flatten a section of clay until it was thin enough to fold like fabric. On multiple occasions I rolled the clay too thin, and the bow tore apart. For the nose, I smashed a shard of obsidian I'd collected on a trip to Yellowstone into fragments, and chose the one best shaped for my purposes.
                
Problems like this were just as, if not more daunting the second time around, now that I knew what to expect but lacked the fresh resolve to attack them. Given the relative lack of quality of the second rabbit, I decided that the sculpture ultimately wasn't enough to represent the sentiment wished to convey to my grandfather. 
                
Thus, I staged am impromptu photo-shoot in my backyard. By that point, the sun was setting and the light was dimming, but it hardly mattered; I knew intended to add an amount of sepia tone and grain in post, in order to mimic old photographs.
                
The photo above is of the first rabbit I made. While the second rabbit isn't visible in this particular picture, it is symbolically represented by the rabbit’s reflection in the mirror behind it. The size of the objects around the rabbit, as well as the angle at which I took the photo, are meant to imply that the rabbit is larger than it is. Though the figure I made was only about the size of my thumb, I wanted to test how realistically I could represent it as a real stuffed rabbit. Combined with the filters, I hoped to create photographs that looked like they could have originated within the setting of the story itself.

The following day, I borrowed a small printer from my mother in order to turn the set of photos I had taken into stickers. I presented these, as well as my second rabbit figure, to my grandfather upon on our next visit, and was pleased that he had read the book understood their full significance.
