                A domain name represents one or more IP addresses. The domain name is comprised of all characters in a website’s URL that follow https://  and precede the first /.

        <h2>Why Domain Names are Important</h2>

        <p>Domain names are easier for humans to remember than IP addresses, which are strings of numbers computers interpret to locate a website.</p>

        <h2>Why Domain Names are Unique</h2>

        <p>All domains are subdomains of another domain. Top-level domains include extensions such as .com and .org, and are the portion of domain names that can be used an unlimited number of times. The first subdomain of a top-level domain will be unique because it belongs to the portion of the domain name that identifies a specific website.</p>

        <h2>Registering a Domain Name</h2>

        <p>To register a domain name, one must acquire one from an accredited registrar. In exchange for a sum of money and contact information, a registrar can provide an unclaimed domain name. The owner then has the right to create a website under said domain name for a finite span of time.</p>

        <h2>Aquiring Domain Names Already in Use</h2>

        <p>If one wishes to acquire a domain name already in use, they can buy it from the owner, or wait for the owner’s lease on the domain name to expire and hope that it isn’t renewed.</p>
