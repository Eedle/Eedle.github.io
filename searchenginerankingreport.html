                <dt>How does a search engine work?</dt>
                <dd>Before a search engine can catalogue an index of webpages, it needs to rely on webcrawlers. Webcrawlers will download a webpage and then follow the links referenced thereon to new pages. In this way, webcrawler programs crawl from one website to another.</dd>
                <dd> A popular algorithm search engines use to rank the importance of the sites webcrawlers record is the Page Rank Algorithm, as developed by Google. According to this algorithm, the number of external links that lead back to a site most significantly affects its placement in search results.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Why do different search-engines give different ranking to websites
                    for the same search phrase?
                </dt>
                <dd>Different search engines rely on different sorting algorithms that value different properties. For instance, some search engines, such as Google, place less value on specific keywords and small phrases than on trying to interpret the full context of what is input into the search bar. A search engine like Bing is more likely to treat the keywords comprising a single query as separate, and target them specifically.</dd>
                <dt>What is a &lt;meta /&gt; tag?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Meta data is information that is readable by machines but that usually doesn’t display in the browser page itself. The &lt;meta /&gt;  tag is always placed within the
                    <head>
                        of a webpage.
                        &lt;meta name=""/&gt; is used to input information such as keywords, descriptions, and author name. Other attributes can be used to specify things like character sets, or how browsers should display the page.
                </dd>
                <dt>What is the purpose for Keyword and Description meta tags?</dt>

                <dd>Meta keywords can be included in html code through the use &lt;meta name="keyword"/&gt;. Historically, some website creators have taken advantage of algorithms that favor meta keywords by including long lists of popular keywords, even if they relevant to their page’s actual content, in order to divert extra traffic to their site. The original point of keyword tags was to make it easier for users to find relevant content related to their search query, and for the websites whose content reflected said tags to attract interested users.</dd>

                <dd>A meta description is a specific attribute of the meta tag that allows creators to write a descriptive blurb surmising their site’s content. This description may or may not be displayed in search engines in favor of text pulled from their page’s main body. Meta descriptions are defined by meta followed name=”’. The description is then specified in the content=”” that follows.</dd>

                <dd>The purpose of a meta description is to allow creators to present the description of their website as they want users to see it when scrolling through search results. </dd>


                <dt>Why might you include meta tags in your pages?</dt>

                 <dd>Meta data is handled differently between web browsers. Both meta keywords and meta description tags may help search engines categorize websites, but aren’t as impactful in website ranking as they used to be.</dd>

                <dd>Meta descriptions make it easier for a web browser to sort websites, and may also make it easier for the user when parsing through search results. A Meta description tag can potentially be more concise and cohesive than what is take from your content by default, though Google may ignore your description in favor of this anyway. </dd>


                <dt>
                    Do meta tags make your pages more easily searchable or improve its
                    ranking?
                </dt>

                <dd>Meta keyword tags are no longer as universally valued as they once were. In Response to their popular abuse, Google officially changed its policy so that meta keywords no longer weigh heavily in their ranking process. However, even in contexts where they don’t heavily skew results on their own, it’s possible they can contribute to search rankings in some small cumulative way. Including keywords in html code generally won’t hurt search results as long as there aren't to many and they are relevant to the site's content. If one intends to include meta tags, it may make a small difference to consult a ranking list and check for the most popular keywords that are also relevant one’s site.</dd>

               <dd>Meta tags such as descriptions and titles have a greater impact on search results. Keywords that appear in meta descriptions will not directly effect ratings within the Google search engine, however, keywords types into the search bar that happen to match the description will be bolded for users, and can in that way attract more traffic.</dd>

                <dd>The title tag is the most impactful meta tag when it comes to determining search ranking.</dd>

                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>* Get external pages to link to the site. If I had social media, it might be a good platform for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>* Give the site pages relevant titles</p>
                    <p>* Include relevant meta data such as keywords and descriptions.</p>
                    <p>* Consult a ranking list to check for the most popular keywords that are also relevant to your site.</p>
                    <p>* Update the website frequently.</p>
                    <p>* If I had lots of money, I could pay a company like Google to advertise my website at the top of relevant search results.</p>

                <dd>I seemed to be on the right track with the titles. A lot of the individual sub-page titles I looked at were short and descriptive of their content. I  may make my titles slightly more specific by labeling each of my hubs/directories as such, and by makeing sure the titles of each of my individual work pages reflect the title of the project they are dedicated to. </dd>

                    I can not discern how this question is meaningfully different from the 5th research question, which I already answered. However, I should mention that it's not my intention that my personal website reach a wide audience. I only intend to publicize my wesbite to specific people to whom I will distribute links.
