        <h2>Quality Assurance in Web Design</h2>

        <p>Within the context of web design, quality assurance is generally a multi-step process meant to ensure the functionality of a website, that specified requirements and industry standards are met, and that aesthetics fall in line with its purpose, design plan, and audience. To accomplish this, one's objectives in creating a website must first be determined, a work on the website must begin, and feedback regarding the aforementioned areas sought. Changes are then made in response to this feedback.  </p>

        <p>Though the processes are complementary, quality assurance testing is considered distinct from user testing, as its goal isn't to identify how users interact and respond to the website.</p>

        <h2>The two key principles of Quality Assurance</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt>
                <b>"Fit for Purpose"</b>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                The website should reflect its stated purpose.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
            <dt>
                <b>"Right First Time"</b>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Mistakes present in the current build should be identified and corrected quickly, and before the website is released.
            </dd>
        </dl>


        <h2>
            How web standards relate to web quality
        </h2>

        <p>Google officially defines a quality website by a number of criteria, including a lack of technical errors, and a well organized layout.</p>

        <p>
            Web standards can work to improve the quality of one's website in a variety of ways. For instance, because they are standardized, holding to specific sets of guidelines when styling one's website can readily allow the content to be easily displayed as intended across a multitude of prominent web browsers. External cascading style sheets can further reduce the size of individual webpages, lowering bandwidth costs across a website's pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>

        <p>How "accessible" a website is correlates to how many people are able to find the website, navigate it, and comprehend its content, particularly those who have some kind of disability that may require special accommodations. Under section 508, federal websites have been required to uphold a number of accessibility standards so that their information can be made available to those with disabilities.</p>

        <p>Common features that improve web accessibility include alternative text for images, skip links at the tops of pages, structural elements that help categorize information semantically, and descriptively named links. Additionally, making use of cascading style sheets helps to separate how a website is displayed stylistically from the structure of its content. This can prevent the semantic misuse of elements and thereby aid in accessibility, as well as decreases bandwidth requirements and page loading times. For the most part, my personal website includes these elements and currently, I don't have to worry about making forms that are easy for people with disabilities to fill out or annotating videos. I have made a special effort to ensure that the sizes of my text elements are defined in terms of ems, allowing them to be easily and relatively resized in one’s individual browser settings. I thought this would be the most important inclusion, considering the group I intend to view my website includes a number of older individuals. </p>

        <p>The area in which I think my website could most be improved is my style sheet. When first creating my website, I intended to control all of my styles through an external style sheet, but couldn't get the background images within my main and navigation elements to load without including the associated CCS internally on each page. I would like to fix this, with the intention of improving loading times.</p>
